# Project configuration

`harness init` writes `.harness/project.yaml`. The file is validated against
`schemas/v1/project-config.schema.json` (unknown keys are rejected) and resolved together with the
technology profiles and the locked core policies into an immutable snapshot whose digests are
recorded on every run. `harness config validate` prints the resolved view.

## File written by `harness init`

This is the file produced for a new Python project (output of `harness init`, unchanged):

```yaml
configVersion: '1.0'
projectId: project_quickstart
workspace:
  root: ..
  units: []
profiles:
- auto
workflow: default_development
capabilities:
  default: deny
  grants: []
validators: []
policies:
  requireHumanDecision: true
  findingBlockSeverities:
  - HIGH
  - CRITICAL
agentProvider: simulated
runtime:
  commandTimeoutSeconds: 900
  maxOutputBytes: 1000000
  maxParallel: 2
  allowNetwork: false
retention:
  artifactDays: 30
  eventDays: 365
```

## Fields

| Field | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `configVersion` | required, `"1.0"` | Configuration format version. |
| `projectId` | required | Identifier used on tasks and runs. `init` derives it from the directory name. |
| `workspace.root` | `..` | Workspace root, relative to `.harness/`. |
| `workspace.units` | `[]` | Declared units (`unitId`, `root`, `profile`). **Declarative: not used by the engine.** |
| `profiles` | `["auto"]` | `auto` selects the detected profiles; otherwise list profile ids (`python_default`, `node_default`). |
| `workflow` | `default_development` | The normative workflow. Only the built-in workflow exists; its phase order is fixed (see issue #3). |
| `capabilities.default` | `deny` | Only `deny` is accepted. |
| `capabilities.grants` | `[]` | Extra grants: `capability`, `scope` (globs or command names), `approvalRequired`, `conditions` (for example `allowDelete`). They are **added** to the profile grants (issue #4). |
| `validators` | `[]` | Validator ids to run; empty means the profile defaults. An id not defined by a selected profile is a configuration error. |
| `policies` | see below | Policy overrides; locked policies can only be restated with their locked value. |
| `agentProvider` | `simulated` | Default provider for `run start` (`--provider` overrides it). |
| `agentProviders` | `{}` | Named command providers: `kind: command`, `command` (argv list, not empty), optional `model`. See [external agents](../guides/external-agents.md). |
| `runtime.commandTimeoutSeconds` | `900` | Timeout of agent-provider processes. Validators use their own `timeoutSeconds` from the profile. |
| `runtime.maxOutputBytes` | `1000000` | Bound on captured stdout/stderr per process (applied after capture, issue #9). |
| `runtime.maxParallel` | `2` | **Declarative: not used by the engine** (phases run sequentially). |
| `runtime.allowNetwork` | `false` | **Declarative: not enforced.** The local runner is not a network sandbox (issue #5). |
| `retention` | written by `init` | **Declarative: no retention job exists.** |

## Policies

Resolution order: core policies, then profile policies, then project policies.

| Policy | Core value | Project may change it? |
|---|---|---|
| `requireHumanDecision` | `true` | **No** (locked `true`) |
| `approvalDigestBinding` | `true` | **No** (locked `true`) |
| `mandatoryNonSuccessBlocks` | `true` | **No** (locked `true`) |
| `retrospectiveAutoApply` | `false` | **No** (locked `false`) |
| `findingBlockSeverities` | `["HIGH", "CRITICAL"]` | Yes: severities whose findings make the gate `FAILED` |
| `allowEmptyChangeSet` | not set (false) | Yes: allow a run whose implementation produced no change |
| `repositoryContentTrusted` | `false` | Declared; **not read by any component** (issue #5) |
| `destructiveActionsDefault` | `deny` | Declared; **not read by any component** (issue #5) |

Setting a locked policy to any other value fails with a configuration error (exit code 2), for
example `project configuration may not weaken locked policy requireHumanDecision`.

## Technology profiles

Profiles are built into the package (`src/governed_harness/resources/profiles/`). Detection is
read-only and reports a confidence with the marker files it found.

| Profile | Detection markers (weight) | Mandatory validator | Optional validators (when available) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `python_default` | `pyproject.toml` (0.80), `requirements.txt` (0.45), `pytest.ini` (0.35) | `python.pytest`: `python -m pytest -q` | `python.ruff`: `python -m ruff check .`, `python.mypy`: `python -m mypy .` |
| `node_default` | `package.json` (0.80), `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock` (0.35 each) | `node.test`: `npm test --silent` (requires a `test` script) | `node.lint`: `npm run lint --silent`, `node.typecheck`: `npm run typecheck --silent` (only if the scripts exist) |

An absent optional validator is recorded as `NOT_APPLICABLE`. An absent mandatory executable is
`BLOCKED`; a mandatory `python -m <module>` whose module is missing currently runs and is reported
as `FAILED` (issue #1).
